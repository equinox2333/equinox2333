### Projects

#### [TsingHelp: A Campus Support App for Tsinghua University Students]((https://github.com/takuyara/TsingHelp)) (Full-stack & Mobile Application Development)

- Led a 9-member team to develop TsingHelp, an Android app enhancing Tsinghua students' campus experience by providing peer support and inquiries, cafeteria reviews, and campus information, attracting hundreds of initial users.
- Technology Stack: Java Android + PHP + Apache + MySQL + Linux

#### Software-Hardware System for Middle Ear Impedance Tester (Full-stack & Embedding System Development)

- Developed a full-stack Windows application using Qt, controlling hardware, displaying auxiliary diagnostic results, and executing data analysis, enhanced with machine learning-based analysis using Python Scikit-learn.
- Developed control units for multiple sensors, handled data acquisition, transmission, and processing, utilizing STM32.

### Research Experience

#### Ensemble Improves Performance in Knowledge Graph Link Property Prediction (Knowledge Graph, Machine Learning)

- Introduced and innovatively applied an ensemble approach to knowledge graph link prediction tasks, ensuring it at the relation level, thereby significantly enhancing model performance by approximately 5%.
- Achieved state-of-the-art results on large-scale knowledge graph benchmark datasets including ogbl-wikikg2 and ogbl-biokg.

#### Zero-shot 3D Point Cloud Completion Based on CLIP Model (3D Vision, Multi-modality)

- Employed the CLIP model to attain zero-shot point cloud completion, using the DeepSDF model to represent 3D objects.
- Implemented a robust pipeline using Python and C++, which involved sampling incomplete point cloud datasets from 3D meshes, rendering differentiable 3D objects, and training DeepSDF models with the CLIP model.
